# Water-Pump-Control-Simulation
In this projects I tried to make a simple simulatation on how you can automatically turn-on and off a water pump or motor base on the water level which. In this project I use an Arduino Uno R3, a Tower Pro 9g Servo Motor, a water level sensor that is included in my Arduino kit, some jumper wires, and a water container to place my sensor.
